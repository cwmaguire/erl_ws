Erlang Cowboy Webserver Experiment

In order to build a Erlang application that would talk to a
websocket I first when through the Cowboy user guide and
implemented a bunch of cowboy features for reference:

- Form POST handling
- Form GET handling
- Reading request body
- Host [...] binding
- Path [...] binding
- Various cowboy_req functions
- Static files
- Static file directory
- Path constraints - int
- Path constraints - boolean
- Path constraints - updated value
- Optional path bindings
- Reading request body in chunks
- Sending response in chunks
- Websocket (server handler and web page)

I started building erl_boids in this app but moved it
to its own repo at:
https://github.com/cwmaguire/erl_boids
