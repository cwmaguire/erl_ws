Erlang Cowboy Webserver Experiment

I want to play with autonomous graphical elements like boids and such,
but I don't want to do all the code in JavaScript. JavaScript is very
interesting but also sucks. Instead I want to do all the logic in Erlang
and connect JavaScript to Erlang via the Cowboy Erlang webserver.

To date I'm simply playing with Cowboy to get a feel for all of the options.

Eventually I want to set up a websocket and have JavaScript on a web page
run all the logic asynchronously through Erlang.

This experiment serves as a reference application showing how different
Cowboy features work:
- Form POST handling
- Form GET handling
- Reading request body
- Host [...] binding
- Path [...] binding
- Various cowboy_req functions
- Static files
- Static file directory
- Path constraints - int
- Path constraints - boolean
- Path constraints - updated value
- Optional path bindings
