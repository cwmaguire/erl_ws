Erlang Cowboy Webserver Experiment

I want to play with autonomous graphical elements like boids and such,
but I don't want to do all the code in JavaScript. JavaScript is very
interesting but also sucks. Instead I want to do all the logic in Erlang
and connect JavaScript to Erlang via the Cowboy Erlang webserver.

To date I'm simply playing with Cowboy to get a feel for all of the options.
