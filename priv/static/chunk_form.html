Logicales, while the rest of the week it was the Organon, Repetition
and Astrology.  The governess was always getting muddled with her
astrolabe, and when she got specially muddled she would take it out of
the Wart by rapping his knuckles.  She did not rap Kay's knuckles,
because when Kay grew older he would be Sir Kay, the master of the
estate.  The Wart was called the Wart because it more or less rhymed
with Art, which was short for his real name.  Kay had given him the
nickname.  Kay was not called anything but Kay, as he was too dignified
to have a nickname and would have flown into a passion if anybody had
tried to give him one.  The governess had red hair and some mysterious
wound from which she derived a lot of prestige by showing it to all the
women of the castle, behind closed doors.  It was believed to be where
she sat down, and to have been caused by sitting on some armour at a
picnic by mistake.  Eventually she offered to show it to Sir Ector, who
was Kay's father, had hysterics and was sent away.  They found out
afterwards that she had been in a lunatic hospital for three years.">
